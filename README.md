# KDD-COVID19
Corona virus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered corona virus. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. For our group project we will using the COVID-19 in USA dataset that's found on kaggle. We will be performing data preprocessing (handling missing data, feature sampling, dimensionality reduction), data visualization, training and testing the model, and then come up with a final conclusion on the Covid-19 dataset to predict the mortality rate for different counties in each state of the United States of America based on median household income, unemployment rate, poverty rate, white alone %, black alone %, asian alone %, hispanic %.


# Columns in the Datatset :
State - County's corresponding State
FIPS - County's corresponding unique FIPS code for identification and convenience
County - Name of county, city, parish, borough, census area, etc.
Population 2018 - County's total population 2018
Median Household Income 2018 ($) - The median of household income counted in 2018
Unemployment Rate 2018 (%) - Percent of total population that is unemployed 2018
Poverty 2018 (%) - Percent of total population living under the poverty line 2018
Confirmed Cases - Cumulative Confirmed COVID-19 Cases updated 6/02/2020
Confirmed Deaths - Cumulative COVID-19 Deaths updated 6/02/2020
Confirmed Cases Per 100,000 people - The number of confirmed COVID19 cases in USA per 100000 people
Deaths Per 100,000 people - The number of deaths due to COVID19 in USA per 100000 people
Mortality Rate (%) - Mortality rate of each county in the USA in %.
White Alone (%) - The % of white people in each county 
Black Alone (%) - The % of white people in each county 
Native American Alone (%) - The % of native american people in each county
